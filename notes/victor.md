# Errors Found during testing
- Dividing by zero produces Infinity
- Entering a number followed by operand then entering multiple zeros leads to a display bug. Refer to zeroBug.mov
- 99999999999 x 2 = 19999999999 (this is incorrect, should be 199999999998). Cutting off the last digits for numbers exceeding the displayable length isn't appropriate for large numbers, only decimals with trailing numbers etc.

# Overall Notes
- I added inline comments throughout your code.
- I thought your code organization was excellent, good modularity, generally pretty clean code. Nice comments to help keep it clear!
- Minor quibbles, just small linting issues, ie. extra white spaces, inconsistent use of ;, small things like that.
- Really good stuff, keep it going!
- I asked a few questions just to get brain juices flowing =).
